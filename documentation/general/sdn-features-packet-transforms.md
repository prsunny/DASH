## First Target Scenario:  SKU for Networked Virtual Appliance (NVA)

Highly Optimized Path, Dedicated Appliance, Little Processing or Encap to SDN
Appliance and Policies on an SDN Appliance Why do we need this scenario?  There
is a huge cost associated with establishing the first connection (and the CPS
that can be established)

## Virtual Port (aka Elastic Network Interface / ENI) and Packet Direction

An SDN appliance in a multi-tenant network appliance (meaning 1 SDN appliance
will have multiple cards; 1 card will have multiple machines or bare-metal
servers), which supports Virtual Ports.   These can map to policy buckets
corresponding to customer workloads, for example: Virtual Machines or Bare Metal
servers servers.

The Elastic Network Interface (ENI), is an independent entity that has a
collection of routing policies. Usually there is a 1:1 mapping between the VM
NIC (Physical NIC) and the ENI (Virtual NIC).  The ENI has specific match
identification criteria, which is used to identify **packet direction**. The
current version only supports **mac-address** as ENI identification criteria. 
  
Once a packet arrives **Inbound** to the target (DPU), it must be forwarded to
the correct ENI policy processing pipeline. This ENI selection is done based on
the **inner destination MAC** of the packet, which is matched against the MAC of
the ENI. 

The SDN controller will create these virtual ports / ENIs on an SDN appliance
and associate corresponding SDN policies such as – Route, ACL, NAT etc. to these
virtual ports.  In other words, our software will communicate with the cards,
hold card inventory and SDN placement, call APIs that are exposed through the
card:  create policies, setup ENI, routes, ACLs, NAT, and different rules.

The following applies:

- Each Virtual Port (ENI) will be created with an ENI identifier such as – Mac
  address, VNI or more.
- A Virtual Port also has attributes such as : *flow time-out*, *QOS*, *port
  properties* related to the port.
- The Virtual Port is the container which holds all policies.

For more information, see **[SDN pipeline basic elements](sdn-pipeline-basic-elements.md#packet-flow---selecting-packet-direction)**.

## Routing (Routes and Route-Action)

Routing must be based on the **Longest Prefix Match** (LPM) and must support all
**underlay and overlay** combinations described below:

- inner IPv4 packet encapsulated in outer IPv4 packet 
- inner IPv4 packet encapsulated in outer IPv6 packet 
- inner IPv6 packet encapsulated in outer IPv4 packet 
- inner IPv6 packet encapsulated in outer IPv6 packet 

The routing pipeline must support the routing models shown below.

### Outbound routing 

1. **Transpositions** 
   - Direct traffic – pass thru with static SNAT/DNAT (IP, IP+Port
   - Packet upcasting (IPv4 -> IPv6 packet transformation) 
   - Packet downcasting (IPv6 -> IPv4 packet transformation) 
1. **Encap** 
   - VXLAN/GRE encap – static rule 
   - VXLAN/GRE encap – based on mapping lookup 
   - VXLAN/GRE encap – calculated based on part of SRC/DEST IP of inner packet 
1. **Up to 3 levels of routing transforms** (example: transpose + encap + encap) 

### Inbound routing 

1. **Decap** 
   - VXLAN/GRE decap – static rule 
   - VXLAN/GRE decap – based on mapping lookup 
   - VXLAN/GRE decap – inner packet SRC/DEST IP calculated based on part of
     outer packet SRC/DEST IP 
1. **Transpositions** 
   - Direct traffic – pass thru with static SNAT/DNAT (IP, IP+Port) 
   - Packet upcasting (IPv4 -> IPv6 packet transformation) 
   - Packet downcasting (IPv6 -> IPv4 packet transformation) 
1. **Up to 3 level of routing transforms** (example: decap + decap + transpose) 

All routing rules must optionally allow for **stamping** the source MAC (to
**enforce Source MAC correctness**), `correct/fix/override source mac`. 

### Route rules processing

#### Outbound (LPM) route rules processing

- Matching is based on destination IP only - using the Longest Prefix Match
(LPM) algorithm.
- Once the rule is matched, the correct set of **transposition, encap** steps
must be applied depending on the rule.
- Only one rule will be matched.

#### Inbound (priority) route rules processing

All inbound rules are matched based on the priority order (with lower priority
value rule matched first). Matching is based on multiple fields (or must match
if field is populated). The supported fields are: 

- Most Outer Source IP Prefix 
- Most Outer Destination IP Prefix 
- VXLAN/GRE key 

Once the rule is matched, the correct set of **decap, transposition** steps must
be applied depending on the rule. **Only one rule will be matched**. 

Also notice the following: 

- Routes are usually LPM based Outbound
- Each route entry will have a prefix, and separate action entry
- The lookup table is per ENI, but could be Global, or multiple Global lookup
  tables per ENIs
- Outer Encap IPv4 using permits routing between servers within a Region; across
  the Region we use IPv6

**Why would we want to use these?**

- Example:  to block prefixes to internal DataCenter IP addresses, but Customer
  uses prefixes inside of their own VNET
- Example:  Lookup between CA (inside Cx own VNET) and PA (Provider Address)
  using lookup table (overwrite destination IP and MAC before encap)
- Example:  Customer sends IPv4, we encap with IPv6
- Example:  ExpressRoute with 2 different PAs specified (load balancing across
  multiple PAs) using 5 tuples of packet to choose 1st PA or 2nd PA

| Route Type| Example
|:----------|:----------
| Encap_with_lookup_V4_underlay| Encap action is executed based on lookup into the mapping table.V4 underlay is used
| Encap_with_lookup_V6_underlay| Encap action is executed based on lookup into the mapping table.V6 underlay is used
| Encap_with_Provided_data (PA)| Encap action is executed based on provided data.Multiple PA can be provided.
| Outbound NAT (SNAT)_L3| L3 NAT action is executed on source IP, based on provided data.
| Outbound NAT (SNAT)_L4| L4 NAT action is executed on source IP, source port based on provided data.
| Null | Blocks the traffic
| Private Link | -

## Packet Flow

For the first packet of a TCP flow, we take the Slow Path, running the
transposition engine and matching at each layer.  For subsequent packets, we
take the Fast Path, matching a unified flow via UFID and applying a
transposition directly against rules.

For more information, see **[SDN pipeline basic elements](sdn-pipeline-basic-elements.md#packet-flow---selecting-packet-direction)**. 

## Packet transforms

See packet transforms in **[SDN pipeline basic elements](sdn-pipeline-basic-elements.md#packet-transforms)**.

## Metering

- Metering will be based on per flow stats, metering engine will consume per
  flow stats of bytes\-in and bytes\-out.

## VNET Encryption

## Telemetry

## Counters

Counters are objects for counting data per ENI. The following are their main
characteristics:

- A counter is associated with only one ENI that is, it is not shared among
  different ENIs.
- If you define a counter as a global object, it cannot reference different
  ENIs.
- The counters live as long as the related ENI exists.  
- The counters persist after the flow is completed.
- You use API calls to handle these counters.
- When creating a route table, you will be able to reference the counters.

The control plane is the consumer of counters that are defined in the data
plane. The control plane queries every 10 seconds.

Counters can be assigned on the route rule, or assigned onto a mapping. If the
mapping does not exist, you revert to the route rule counter. A complete
definition will follow when we have more information other than software defined
devices.  

In the flow table we list the packet counter called a 'metering' packet; once we
have the final implementation that does the packet processing, we can do
metering.

Essentially, whenever a route table is accessed and we identify the right VNET
target (based on the mapping from the underlay IP), will have an ID of the
metering packet preprogrammed earlier.  We will reference this counter in the
mappings. When the flow is created it will list this counter ID.  When the
packet transits inbound or outbound through the specific flow, this counter is
incremented and tracked separately for the inbound and outbound.

Some specific counters (such as memory use of a card, etc...) are global,
however most of the counters should be per ENI as processing of rules and drops,
accepts, list of flows etc are per ENI.

We need more information around Counters, Statistics, and we need to start
thinking about how to add Metering- and reconcile this in the P4 model.

**Questions**  

- How often will we read?  
- What type of API to use?  
- Will we push or pull from the Controller?

## BGP

Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) is a standardized exterior gateway protocol
designed to exchange routing and reachability information among autonomous
systems on the Internet. BGP is classified as a path-vector routing protocol and
it makes routing decisions based on paths, network policies, or rule-sets
configured by a network administrator. For more information, see [Border Gateway
Protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Border_Gateway_Protocol).

## Watchdogs

## Servicing

## Debugging

Counters per rule to trace an increment per layer, ACL hits, Packet Captures,
Bandwidth Metering for Routing Rules to count bytes (each flow associated with a
bandwidth counter when an LPM is hit \- many flows *may* share the same
counters).

## Flow Replication

For information about flow replication, see **[DASH
High-Availability](../../high-avail/README.md)**.

## Unit Testing and development

- Need ability to run rule processing behavior on dev box / as part of merge
  validation.

## Internal Partner dependencies

- SLB VXLAN support

- Reduced tuple support on host.
