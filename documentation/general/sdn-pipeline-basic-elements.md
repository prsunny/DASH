## Packet flow - selecting packet direction

On receiving a packet from the wire, the SDN appliance will determine the
**packet direction**, **matching ENI**, and **packet processing strategy** based
on *Encap Transformation and Rules Evaluation*. See also [Packet
Flows](dash-sonic-hld.md#2-packet-flows) in the *SONiC-DASH integration high
level design* document. 

- **Packet direction**. It is evaluated based on the most-outer **Virtual
  Network Identifier** (VNI) lookup (implementation dependent) behind the
  Appliance.  If there is no match, the direction is **Inbound**. If it matches with a reserved VNI, then the direction is Outbound.
- **ENI selection**. Outbound uses source-MAC, Inbound uses destination-MAC
- **SLB decap** if packet was encapsulated by **Software Load Balancer** (SLB).
- **Decap VNET** Generic Routing Encapsulation (GRE) key

The following figure shows the preliminary steps to determine the packet
direction prior to selecting a fast or slow path.

![eni-match-flow-direction](./images/sdn/eni-match-flow-direction.svg)

The Elastic Network Interface (ENI), is an independent entity that has a
collection of routing policies. ENI has specified identification criteria, which
are also used to identify **packet direction**. The current version only
supports **mac-address** as ENI identification criteria. 

Once a packet arrives on **Inbound** to the target (DPU), it must be forwarded
to the correct ENI policy processing pipeline. This ENI selection is done based
on the **inner destination MAC** of the packet, which is matched against the MAC
of the ENI. 

Cloud Service Providers and enterprises that are deploying Software Defined
Networking (SDN) can use **Software Load Balancer** (SLB) to evenly distribute
tenant and tenant customer network traffic among virtual network resources. SLB
enables multiple servers to host the same workload, providing high availability
and scalability.

## Packet flow - selecting packet path

For the **first packet** of a TCP flow, the **slow path** is selected, running
the transposition engine and matching at each layer.  
For **subsequent packets**, the **fast path** is selected, matching a unified
flow via UFID and applying a transposition directly against rules.

### Fast path

Once the ENI is matched, the packet is first matched with flow table to check
whether an existing flow already matches.  If a flow match is found (**fast
path**), a corresponding match action is executed without entering into rule
processing. Flow match direction is identified based on source and destination
MAC.

#### Inbound fast path

  ![inbound-fast-path](./images/sdn/inbound-fast-path-flow.svg)

#### Outbound fast path

  ![outbound-fast-path](./images/sdn/outbound-fast-path-flow.svg)

> [!NOTE] In the case of Software Load Balancer (SLB), in the fast path,
> Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) redirect is **only supported in
> TCP**; it is not supported in UDP.

### Slow path

If no flow match is found (**slow path**), the ENI rule processing pipeline will
execute.

#### Inbound slow path

**Inbound rule** processing pipeline is executed if destination MAC in the
packet matches the ENI MAC. Once rule pipeline is executed corresponding flows
are created.

![inbound-slow-path](./images/sdn/inbound-slow-path-flow.svg)

#### Outbound slow path

**Outbound rule** processing pipeline is executed if source MAC in the packet
matches the ENI MAC.

![outbound-slow-path](./images/sdn/outbound-slow-path-flow.svg)

- Once outbound rule processing is complete and final transforms are identified,
  the corresponding flow is created in the flow table.

- Depending upon the implementation of the flow table, a corresponding inbound
  flow may also be inserted to enable response packets to match the flow and
  bypass the rule processing pipeline.
- Note: the VNI is **static** on the 'left-side' (most-outer) of the diagram
  (there is only 1 encap) from the reserved VNI range
- The VNI will be **different** depending upon the Inbound 'right-side'
  circumstance (Internet, ER Gateway for example)

<!--
**Example**: VM with IP 10.0.0.1 sends a packet to 8.8.8.8, VM Inbound ACL blocks all internet, VM outbound ACL allows 8.8.8.8 \- Response packet from 8.8.8.8 must be allowed without opening any inbound ACL due to the flow match.

## Packet processing pipeline

The processing of a packet is based on a set of tables and policies stored in
the data plane (DPU) and configured based on information sent by the control
plane (SDN controller). The following figure shows how tables and policies
relate to the Virtual Port (ENI). 

![sdn-virtual-port](images/sdn/sdn-virtual-port.svg)

> [!NOTE] DASH processing pipeline must support both IPv4 and IPv6 protocols for
> both underlay and overlay, unless explicitly stated that some scenario is
> IPv4-only or IPv6-only. 

Below are listed some of the most common packet processing terms. 

- **Flow**. It describes a specific *conversation* between two hosts (SRC/DST
  IP, SRC/DST Port). When a flow is processed and policy is applied to it and
  then routed, the DPU (SmartNIC) records the outcomes of all those decisions in
  a **transform** and places them in the **flow table** which resides locally on
  the card itself.  

  > [!NOTE] This is why sometimes the terms *transform* and *flow* are used
  > interchangeably.

- **Transform**. It is represented either by *iflow* (initiator) or *rflow*
  (responder) in the **flow table**. It **contains everything the DPU needs to
  route a packet to its destination without first having to apply a policy**.
  Whenever the DPU receives a packet, it checks the local *flow table* to see if
  the preparatory work has been done for this flow. The following can happen:

  - When a *transform* or *flow* doesn’t exist in the *flow table*, a **slow
    path** is executed and policy applied.
  - When a *transform* or *flow* does exist in the *flow table*, a **fast path**
    is executed and the values in the transform are used to forward the packet
    to its destination without having to apply a policy first.

- **Mapping table**. It is tied to the V-Port, and contains the CA:PA (IPv4,
  IPv6) mapping, along with the FNI value of the CA for Inner Destination MAC
  re-write and VNID to use for VXLAN encapsulation.

  > [!NOTE] The Flexible Network Interface (FNI) is a 48-bit value which easily
  > maps to MAC values. The MAC address of a VNIC (VM NIC or BareMetal NIC) is
  > synonymous with FNI. It is one of the values used to identify a V-Port
  > container ID.  

- **Routing table**. It is a match.action table, specifically a longest prefix
  match (LPM) table that once matched on destination specifies the action to
  perform VXLAN encapsulation based on variables already provided, VXLAN encap
  using a **mapping table** or *Overlay Tunnel* lookup for variables, or *L3/L4
  NAT*. Routing tables are mapped to the V-Port.

- **Flow table**. A global table on a DPU that contains the transforms for all
  of the per-FNI flows that have been processed through the data path pipeline.


### Access Control Lists (ACLs)

The Access Control Lists (ACLs) play a fundamental role during packet
processing. ACLs evaluation is done in stages, if a packet is allowed through
the first stage, it is processed by the second ACL stage and so on. For a packet
to be allowed it must be allowed in all the stages or must hit a terminating
allow rule. 

#### ACL groups

ACLs are evaluated in both **Inbound** and **Outbound** direction; there are
separate groups for Inbound and Outbound. 

The updating of an ACL group must be an atomic operation. No partial updates are
allowed, as it might lead to security issues in the case of only partial rules
being applied. 

ACL groups need to be evaluated in order. The following rules apply:

- Each ACL group has a set of rules. Only a single rule can match in
  group/stage. 
  - Once the rule is matched, its action is performed (**allow** or **deny**).
  - The packet processing moves to the next ACL group/stage; a match is found,
    no further rules in same group are evaluated. 

- Within an ACL group, rules are organized by priority (with lowest priority
  number being evaluated first). 
  - No two rules have the same priority within a group. 
  - Priority is only within rules in the same group. No priorities across groups
    are allowed. 
  - A smaller priority number means the rule will be evaluated first.
  - Priorities are unique withing an ACL group. Priorities might overlap across
    ACL groups. 

#### ACL levels

The ACL pipeline has 3-5 levels; an ACL decision is based on the most
restrictive match across all 3 levels.  

- The first layer (contains default rules) is *controlled by Azure/MSFT*.  
- The second and 3rd layers are *Customer controlled*.
- The 4th and 5th layers might be for example, *VM/Subnet/Subscription* layers.
  These layers might be security rules or a top level entity controlled by an
  Administrator or an IT Department.

#### ACL rules

A rule can be **terminating** or **non-terminating**. 

- **terminating** rule means that this is the final outcome and further
  processing through other groups/stages must be skipped. 
  - **deny** rules are usually *terminating*. 

- **non-terminating** rule means that further processing through other
  groups/stages is required. 
  - **allow** rules are usually *non-terminating”*. 
  - **deny** rules can sometimes be also *non-terminating* (also known as **soft
    deny**). This means that a particular ACL group *proposes* to deny the
    packet, but its decision is not final, and can be **overridden**, switched
    to *allow* by the next group/stage. 

- If an ACL rule with bit exit ACL pipeline on hit is matched, the ACL pipeline
  is abandoned.
- Expected ACL scale \- max 100k prefixes, max 10k ports
- ACL table entry count = 1000 per table. (NOTE: Each table entry can have comma
  separated prefix list.)

The end result of the ACL logic for packet evaluation leads to a single outcome:
**allow** or **deny**.

- If the **allow** outcome is reached the **packet is moved to next processing
  pipeline**. 
- If the **deny** outcome is reached the **packet is silently dropped**. 

#### ACL actions  

- Block (terminate)
- If ‘terminate’ is not used here, the last line is the most important in ACL
  Level1
- Soft Block (general block, with specific permits, non-terminating, proceed to
  next group) or think of this as a Block, and then a ‘no’ for ‘termination’.
- Allow (non-terminate, proceed to next, continue to FW rules)  
- Default action = Deny. This is the default value if no rules are matched;
  traffic should be dropped.  This is the default action of firewalls, however
  it is OK to be configurable.  If not, we want to default Deny/Drop if no rules
  are matched.

- ACL Group:  evaluate rules based on Priority (within an ACL Group); Terminate
  vs non-Terminate pertains to the Pipeline

**ACL_LEVEL3**

Etc…

**Order of evaluation / priority of evaluation**

- ACL_LEVEL1 \-> ACL_LEVEL2

**Test Scenarios and expected results**

- For simplicity below table only has IP conditions, but the same combinations
  exist for ports also.

- ACL rules are direction aware, below example is assuming a VM with source IP =
  10.0.0.100 which is trying to send packets to various destinations and has
  above ACL rules on its v\-port.

**Outbound Traffic example evaluation and outcome**

## Packet transforms

This section describes the packet transforms that are specific for each
scenario. After rule processing is complete and transforms are identified, the
corresponding flow is created in the flow table.

> [!NOTE] The following diagrams show packet transforms as they are done currently that
> is **without DASH optimization**.

### VM to VM (in VNET) communication

Please note that VNET to VNET is seen below.  VNET Peering is identical and no datapath changes are needed.  VNET Global Peering uses IPv6 as the tunnel and uses the same tunnel format.
