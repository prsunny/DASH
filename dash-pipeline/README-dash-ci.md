This project contains [Git Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) to perform continuous integration whenever certain actions are performed. These are specified in YAML files under [.github/workflows](../.github/workflows) directory.

There are several such `.yml` files and each one has specific trigger criteria and job specifications. These job specifications call out a sequence of steps, which in our case are `Makefile` build and/or test targets, similar to those you'd do "manually" as a developer.

The main CI job called `DASH-BMV2-CI ` is to rebuild the entire dash-pipeline and run all the tests whenever any of the dependencies change: P4 code, Makefiles, scripts and tests, etc. This can be used to ensure new features and build recipes work, test-cases pass and regressions didn't creep in.

There are also numerous `DASH-DOCKER-xxx` jobs which rebuild the various "builder" docker images. These are not invoked as often and are used to verify the infrastructure itself.

Finally, CI Actions are used to publish Docker Images. See [Publishing Docker Images to Azure Container Registry](README-dash-docker.md#publishing-docker-images-to-azure-container-registry)
# CI Badges
* The CI badges will be updated according to the CI build status and appear on the front page of the repository (it's actually on the top-level README). You can click on this icon to drill down into the Git Actions history and view pass/fail details. Typical icons appear below:

  ![CI-badge-passing.svg](../assets/CI-badge-passing.svg)  ![CI-badge-failing.svg](../assets/CI-badge-failing.svg)  

Badges have flexibility, for example we could show the status of more than one branch at a time.

### CI Build log - Passing example

A typical "Good" CI log appears below, this can be watched in real-time:

![CI-build-log-ok.png](../assets/CI-build-log-ok.png)  

### CI Build log - Fail example
A typical "Failed" CI log appears below. You can click on the arrow next to the red circled "X" and see details. In this example there is a (deliberate) P4 coding error.

![CI-build-log-fail.png](../assets/CI-build-log-fail.png)

Let's drill down into the Build P4 step which failed. We see a a bad statement. (There is no `#import` keyword for P4 or the C preprocessor).
```
#import DOH.h
```

The main README for this repository shows the CI failing badge:
