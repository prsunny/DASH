# SONiC-DASH Testing
This directory contains documentation, test scripts, test configurations and other artifacts required to test a SONiC-DASH device or devices. The focus is on executable test artifacts, not test requirements.

For hard requirements, see [main Documentation Table of Contents](../documentation/README.md#contents) and navigate to the particular **requirements** section.

You can start with the [High-Level Description (HLD) Test Specification](docs/dash-test-HLD.md) or go to the [Test Docs Table of Contents](docs/README.md).
